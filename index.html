<p>Hi Everyone! I have always been hoping to create a professional website and I think this should be a start.</p>
<p>My name is Zhibo Yu (喻知博). I am currently an undergraduate student in Fudan University, Shanghai, China. </p>
<p>I am interested in studying astrophysical X-ray sources, especially stellar mass black holes in X-ray binaries or supermassive black holes in AGNs by analyzing their spectral features or timing properties. </p>
